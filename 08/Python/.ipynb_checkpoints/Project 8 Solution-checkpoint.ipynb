    "# Project 8: Virtual Machines with Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, we implemented a virtual machine that could perform simple computations using a stack. Although interesting, and perhaps easier to work with than assembly, code written for this machine is still not very expressive. While it is easier to write out calculations than in Hack Assembly, code written for our VM language is still very repetitive, and expression of complex ideas is still very difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we will add code to our virtual machine implementations to allow for the definition and application of subroutines. By supporting subroutines, our virtual machines will be able to represent the kinds of thoughts high level programmers tend to think.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a subroutine, really?\n",
    "\n",
    "We've been using subroutines in Python as a way to logically divide our program into reusable parts. In general, a subroutine takes several arguements or parameters, performs some operations in a way that does not affect the rest of the program (except possibly some global state variables), and then returns some useful result. For example, here's a subroutine in `Python` that computes the sum and product of two arguements (a and b), and returns a value based on which is larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_subroute(a, b):\n",
    "    c = a + b\n",
    "    d = a*b\n",
    "    if c > d:\n",
    "       return a\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "       return b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this in the context of the virtual machine, we'll need to do several things each time a subroutine is called:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Push all of the arguments (like a and b) on the stack, in a particular order.\n",
    "- Push \n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools and Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already know one or more high level languages, you should be able to complete the project exactly as outlined in Section 7.5 of your textbook. Reading further in this document may be unhelpful, as there are more elegant designs for the VM translator than the one used here. This is because we will only be using a subset of the features available in high level languages like `Python`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you didn't know a high level language before starting the course, read on!\n",
    "\n",
    "As with Project 7, we'll be using `Python` today to continue writing a *virtual machine translator*. This program will take a file written in the virtual machine language (described in Chapters 7 and 8 of your textbook), and convert (or *compile*) it to Hack Assembler. Once this program is done, we'll be able write higher level programs in the virtual machine language, translate them to Hack, and then use the assembler we wrote in Project 6 to convert them to binary commands.\n",

    "# The Flow Control Module\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of Project 8 consists of writing a new module to handle the six new flow-control commands. This module is essentially an extension of the code-writer module from Project 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help write this module, two useful subroutines have been provided at the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "`registerValuePush(where, mode)` will output the assembly code required to push content from a given memory address or label to the stack. For example `registerValuePush(LCL, 1)` will push the value of @LCL to the stack, while `registerValuePush(LCL, 0)` will push the address of @LCL to the stack. The second argument controls whether the address or the value at that address are pushed.\n",
    "\n",
    "`setReg(target, source, offset)` will output the assembly code required to copy the value stored at @(@target-offset) to @source. For example, after calling `setReg(LCL, SP, 4)` will copy the fourth item from the top of the stack into @LCL. This may be very useful when writing a return.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You should implement the seven other subroutines in three stages. A more detailed description of the subroutines can be found in Chapter 8 of your textbook. First implement these three:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `writeLabel(name)`: prints an assembly code translation of the VM language command \"label name\".\n",
    "2. `writeGoto(name)`: prints an assembly code translation of the VM language command \"goto name\". A goto serves much the same purpose as an unconditional jump (0;JMP).\n",
    "3. `writeIf(name)`: prints an assembly code translation of the VM language command \"if-goto name\". An if-goto serves much the same purpose as a conditional jump (e.g. D;JEQ), but always checks two see whether the top of the stack is 0 before jumping.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have implemented these first three subroutines, you should complete the test module at the end of this file, and make sure your code can pass the first two tests. Use the CPU-Emulator to test the Hack Assembly code produced by your program. As usual, test scripts are provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "After your program passes the first two tests, you should write the next three subroutines:\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `writeFunction(name, numlocals)`: prints an assembly code translation of the VM language command \"function name numlocals\". This command corresponds to `def name` in `Python`. It defines the start of a function. However, unlike in Python, a function in VM language must specify the number of local variables it will store, so that we can make space for them on the stack. This function should both print out a label for this function, and print out assembly code to push `numlocals` 0's onto the stack.\n",
    "5. `writeCall(name, args)`: prints an assembly code translation of the VM language command \"call name\". This should output assembly code to save the current context to the stack, compute the new context for the next function call, and then actually call the function. Finially, it should output a unique label indicating the return address of the function call.\n",
    "6. `writeReturn(name)`: prints an assembly code translation of the VM language command \"return\". This output assembly code to restore the context of the stack just prior to the current function call by using the FRAME pointer, and should ensure that the top element of the stack is the return value. It should then jump to the return address of the function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, your program should be able to pass the next two tests, SimpleFunction and NestedFunction. If you can pass SimpleFunction, but not NestedFunction, there is probably something wrong with the way your program stores context.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have passed the tests for SimpeFunction and NestedFunction, you should implement the final function, `writeInit()`. This subroutine should write out the standard 5 lines that start any VM program (described in the book), followed by writing out exactly the assembly code required for a call to the function Sys.init, which takes no arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have written writeInit(), you can try the multi-unit compilation test, FibonacciElement. This test has two .vm files that have to be compiled into a single .asm file. You can accomplish this just by uncommenting the lines in the test module. \n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of problems can manifest when you test FibonacciElement. The test is supposed to compute the 4th number in the Fibonacci sequence, which is 3. If your program is computing 4, it is likely that you are outputing some incorrect labels. Look over the labels in your assembly code. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, after you should modify your Code module to support pushing to the static memory segment. This involves a very small change to the writePushPop function. Following this, you can complete the final test, which involves compilation of three different files, each of which will attempt to use the static segment. If you do not pass the test, you have probably forgotten to include the current filename as part of a static variable name.\n"
