    "# Project 6: An Assembler for Our Computer\n",
    "\n",
    "Project 6 is the first part of the course where it is useful to have learned a high level programming language in advance. If you already know a high level language (like Java, Python, C++, or Lisp), you can implement the assembler without following the steps laid out here, and just conforming to the specification on pages 113-115 of the textbook. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't know a high level language, then read on!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's a high level language?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Project 5, we were able to write very simple programs that ran on our computers in the Hack assembly language. Writing programs in Hack was easier than writing them in binary, but each Hack command was *directly* equivalent to a binary number. These binary numbers would cause our computers to execute the appropriate command when interpreted as an instruction. This is the essential feature of low level languages like assembly languages and simple early programming languages. The instructions that you write in a low level language have almost (or exactly) the same meaning a single binary instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "High level languages make use of a higher level of *abstraction* then low level languages. In a high level language, a single command might be equivalent to a large number of binary instructions. For example, we saw that in the Hack language, multiplying two numbers is a rather involved process. However, in a high level language, a complex equation like $\\sqrt{a*b + c*d}$ may be computed in a single command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "c = a*b + c*d\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, high level languages are easier for humans to read and understand. However, since what they describe is further removed from what is happening in the machine, subtle misunderstandings can sometimes lead programmers to write less efficient code. This is one of the reasons for learning more about how computers actually work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are only a few major assembly languages in use, there are many different high level languages. Different high level languages make the expression of certain ideas easier or harder for the programmer, and the philosophies of different language designers lead to radically different notions of what constitutes a \"good\" high level language. The design of new programming languages is an active field of research, but there are only a few major languages in use at any one time. The `C` language and its descendents `C++` and `Java`, are the most widely known and the most used in professional software development. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, students who do not already know a high level language will learn the basics of the `Python` language. `Python` is the most popular language after those in `C` family. It is considered to be a good language for beginners, and is also widely used by the scientific community and in web development. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## From Hack to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the concepts we learned about in the Hack assembly language, or in HDL, are present in Python in a more abstracted form. Ultimately, very little will need to be learned except how to express these familiar concepts in a new language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Registers are like Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the assignment, you will need to write a program that controls the state of several `Python` *variables*. A variable in `Python` is like a register in the Hack assembly language. However, while a Hack register can hold only a single 16-bit value, a variable in `Python` can hold many different types of data, including 64-bit integers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 1234\n",
    "y = -5678\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or single bits:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = True\n",
    "y = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or alpha-numeric characters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 'a'\n",
    "y = 'b'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as many other types of values, which are not needed for Project 6. As mentioned above, this is a higher-level abstraction. `Python` code is *automatically* translated into lower-level code that handles the inner workings of representing and using regular registers to represent all of these different kinds of values. For now, we don't need to worry about exactly how all this happens. Later in the course, we'll have a chance to implement our own high-level language, to get a feel for what's happening here.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chips are like Subroutines\n",
    "\n",
    "In HDL, we created more complex chips out of smaller, reusable, chip designs. Similarly, in Python, we will create more complex programs out of smaller, reusable, programs. In this course, we will cause these smaller programs \"subroutines\". In other languages or contexts, they are called \"methods\" or \"functions\". \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you declare the start of a new subroutine with the command `def`. Here's an example of a subroutine that adds together four inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_subroutine(a,b,c,d):\n",
    "    return a + b + c + d\n",
    "```\n",
    "The keyword `def` indicates that this line starts a new subroutine. Every line after this one that is part of the subroutine must be indented with a single tab. The `:` at the end of the first line is required. `my_subroutine` is just a name. You can pick (almost) any name that you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "The keyword `return` indicates the value the subroutine will emit when its computations are completed. A subroutine can have many lines with `return`, but the program will jump to the exit of the subroutine the first time it executes one (you might jump over several without executing them though).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, unlike in HDL, the inputs are *implicitly* assumed to be numbers (in fact, 64-bit numbers in this case), rather than bits. You do not need to specify the type of the input. Instead, just use it the way you intend. As mentioned above, this abstraction makes the subroutine easier to read, but it might also do something unexpected if the wrong kind of input is given to it. It is up to the programmer to keep track of what type of data needs to go where!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mux = If = Jump\n",
    "Often in HDL, we wanted to produce an output that depended on one or more of the inputs. This was accomplished using a multiplexer, or mux. For example, if the two control bits were positive, we might produce an output of `a and b`, while if they were both zero, we might produce an output of `a or b`. In Python, the `if` command serves a similar function, but is much more powerful. Here's a simple example that acts like a 2-way mux:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_conditional_subroutine(a,b,control):\n",
    "    if control == 1:\n",
    "        return a\n",
    "    else\n",
    "        return b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and here's another that acts like a 4-way mux:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_4way_conditional(a,b,c,d,control):\n",
    "    if control == 1:\n",
    "        return a\n",
    "    elif control == 2:\n",
    "        return b\n",
    "    elif control == 3:\n",
    "        return c\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return d\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that unlike with the 4-way mux, only one control variable is needed, and we can check whether it is equal to many different values. Note also the keyword `elif`, which is short for \"else if\" or \"otherwise, if\". The correct way to read read the code is \"if control is equal to 1, return a. Otherwise, if control is equal to 2, return b. Otherwise, if control is equal to 3, return c. Otherwise, return d.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think about the if statement is as a jump command in Hack. If the condition is untrue, then we jump to the next line with the same indentation as this one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many different expressions can be used in an `if` statement. For now, we only need to learn about two. The `==` statement tests whether two things are *identical*. For example `control == 1` is true if and only if control is the number 1. The `!=` statement tests whether two things are *different*. For example, `control != 1` is true if and only if control is not the number 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strings: Like a Bus\n",
    "\n",
    "The last concept needed for this assignment is a string. Like other high level languages, `Python` supports the concept of strings of characters, to make it easier to work with works. You can think of a string as being a bit like a bus of variable width. For example, the string `\"alligator\"` is a bus 9 characters wide, while the string `\"fish\"` is only 4 characters wide.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access individual characters in a string much like you would in a bus. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def alligator_subroutine(a,b):\n",
    "    x = \"alligator\"\n",
    "    if x[2] == 'a':\n",
    "        return a\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while `\"Alligator\"` is a string, `'a'` is just a single character, much like the difference between a 16-bit bus (which might represent a number), and a single bit of that bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like with a bus, you can access contiguous subsections of a string by specifying the start and end points. For example, this subroutine returns the string `\"gator\"`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def gator_subroutine():\n",
    "    x = \"alligator\"\n",
    "    return x[4:9]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this works a little differently from in HDL. The first number indicates the starting point of the slice of the string we want, like in HDL. However, the second number is actually one past the end of the slice we want. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since strings can be of variable length, you might wonder how you can tell how wide a string is. Python provides a subroutine called `len` that accepts a string, and returns its length:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def gator_subroutine():\n",
    "    x = \"alligator\"\n",
    "    return x[4:len(x)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`Python` also provides a number of shortcuts to make this easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    x = \"alligator\"\n",
    "    x[4:9] #\"gator\"\n",
    "    x[4:]  #also \"gator\". If you the second number is omitted, it defaults to len(x)\n",
    "    x[-5:] #also \"gator\". -5 means \"Five from the end of the string\". \n",
    "    x[:4] #\"alli\". If the first number is omitted, it defaults to 0.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is sometimes very helpful to check where a given character is in a string, or whether it is present at all. The `find` subroutine allows this by returning the index of the character if it is present, or -1 if it is not present. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def gator_index(s):\n",
    "    if s.find(\"g\"):\n",
    "        return s.find(\"g\")\n",
    "    else\n",
    "        return \"No gators here.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keyboard Input\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most high level languages, Python supports a wide variety of powerful ways to read input from the keyboard, or from files. A full understanding of these input capabilities is not required for this course. To assist you, a file called Project6IO.py has been provided, which contains a set of simple functions that will handle input for this project. Think of this as a set of built in \"chips\" you can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we just need to learn about one subroutine from this file, called `IO.nextline`. Later in the project, other functions from the file will be introduced as the become necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `IO.nextline()` subroutine will return the next line corresponding to an assembly instruction. It will automatically skip over any comments or blank lines, and will automatically remove any leading or trailing spaces from the line it returns. When there is no more input to read, it will return \"EOF\", a common abbreviation for \"End Of File\". \n",

    "# Writing Python Code\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "# The Parser\n",
    "Now we know all the tools needed to start working on Project 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of writing an assembler is to write a *parser* module. The parser module will contain a number of subroutines that read a line of Hack assembly, and split it into the constituent parts, making it easier to translate the parts into binary codes later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Parser module has eight subroutines, which are listed in the table on pages 113-114 of your textbook. However, most of these  are quite simple.

Read over these functions carefully to make sure you understand their operation, but do not change them.\n",
