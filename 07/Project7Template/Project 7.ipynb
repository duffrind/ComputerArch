    "# Project 7: A Virtual Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "While working on project 6 you were told to 'reset the machine' (by pressing the button next to stop at the top of the screen) when you got stuck. But pressing the button clearly doesn't restart your computer. Where is the machine that you're resetting?\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have guessed from this week's readings, the machine in question is actually an emulated virtual machine, called the `Python` Interpreter. It's a much more powerful and complex sort of virtual machine than the system we'll build today (kind of like the difference between a RISC and CISC CPU design), but the principle is similar. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Virtual Machines?\n",
    "\n",
    "High level languages like `Python` allow programmers to concisely express complex ideas. But more than this, the ability to concisely express these ideas helps programmers to *think*. Imagine trying to implement the Hack Assembler from Project 6 a low level language like Hack assembly itself. You'd end up worrying about all kinds of little details, because even something as simple as reading one line would involve many different operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Translating a high level language into a low level language is tricky because of the very different types of thoughts being represented. To make this easier, a virtual machine defines an architecture that can more easily translate between these two kinds of concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Project 7, we'll implement the first part of a virtual machine, which will allow the creation of a *stack machine*, a useful abstraction.  Next week, Project 8 will focus on the implementation of subroutines on the virtual machine, greatly expanding the kinds of ideas that can be expressed in the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools and Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already know one or more high level languages, you should be able to complete the project exactly as outlined in Section 7.5 of your textbook. Reading further in this document may be unhelpful, as there are more elegant designs for the VM translator than the one used here. This is because we will only be using a subset of the features available in high level languages like `Python`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you didn't know a high level language before starting the course, read on!\n",
    "\n",
    "As with Project 6, we'll be using `Python` today to write a *virtual machine translator*. This program will take a file written in the virtual machine language (described in Chapter 7 of your textbook), and convert (or *compile*) it to Hack Assembler. Once this program is done, we'll be able write higher level programs in the virtual machine language, translate them to Hack, and then use the assembler we wrote in Project 6 to convert them to binary commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "You already know almost all of the `Python` commands needed to complete this program, but if you've forgotten them, you can always re-read the Chapter 6 notebook for a refresher. Two other helpful commands are the `split` and `+` operations for strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "`split` will divide a string into pieces that correspond to individual words. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s=\"push constant 5\"\n",
    "s.split()[0] # The string \"push\"\n",
    "s.split()[1] # The string \"constant\"\n",
    "s.split()[2] # The string \"5\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to add a string to something else with the `+` operator, `Python` will produce a new string that joins the items together:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "index = 5\n",
    "foo=\"@\"+index #foo is now the string \"@5\"\n",
    "bar = foo + \" is the same as \" + foo #bar is now the string \"@5 is the same as @5\".\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're feeling confident, you can work on the project without using the templates below. Begin by reading Chapter 7, and then making three blank notebooks: one for the Parser Module, one for the CodeWriter module, and one for the main program. Section 7.5 outlines a reasonable way to go about writing these modules, and including\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "at the start of your Parser module will give you access to all the same input and output subroutines you were able to use in Project 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to practice your `Python` with a little more structure, the three notebooks below provide a template for completing these files that you can fill in, much like with Project 6 last week.\n",

    "# The Parser Module\n",
    "\n",
    "The first module we'll write is the Parser Module. This module is much like the Parser Module from Project 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the VM language, each command we'll implement this week consists of either 1 and 3 words on a single line, separated by spaces. The line represents a command, which will either push something on the stack, pop something off the stack, or perform some arithmetic. In this week's project, we will only implement push, pop, and the nine arithmetic commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Parser contains an *advance()* sub-routine, which populates three state variables, corresponding to the first (nexttype), second (nextarg1), and third (nextarg2) parts of the current command. If a command does not have values for all these variables, set the unneeded ones to the empty string \"\". For example, the command \"add\" has no arguments, so after reading \"add\", nexttype should be \"add\", nextarg1 should be \"\", and nextarg2 should be \"\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The other subroutines should simply return the current values of nexttype, nextarg1, and nextarg2. The book defines three types of commands: \"C_PUSH\", \"C_POP\", and \"C_ARITHMETIC\" that should be returned by the commandType() function in place of the raw values of nexttype. Note also the special behaviour of arg1() when commandType() is \"C_ARITHMETIC\".\n",

    "The only other module we need for this week's project is the CodeWriter module. Predictably, this module writes assembly code out, in response to VM language commands that are read in by the Parser module. Basically it translates from VM Language to Hack Assembly, in much the same way the assembler translated from Hack Assembly to Binary Hack Machine Code. However, while each Hack Assembly instruction was mapped to just a single Hack Machine Code instruction, each VM Language instruction will produce *many* Hack Assembly instructions. This is what gives the VM Language its extra power: a single thought can produce many effects at once.\n",

    "As an example, consider the \"add\" command in the VM Language. Conceptually, the \"add\" command is supposed to pop two items from the top of the stack, add them together, and put the result back on the stack. By convention, register 0 (@SP) contains the memory address of the top of the stack. So the assembly code to carry out the VM Language \"add\" might be:\n",
